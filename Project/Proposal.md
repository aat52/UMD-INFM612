# Final Project Proposal

Each student team will undertake a research/consulting study on a management topic the team chooses. The study should identify a management issue (e.g., a problem or opportunity) faced by one or more organizations, any type of organizations (e.g., multinationals, small/medium-sized, startups, functions/departments, project teams, online communities, platforms, ecosystems, etc.). It should seek to recommend strategies to address the issue identified (e.g., solving the problem or taking the opportunity).

In your project proposal, please include the following items:

- What is the management problem or opportunity in what organization(s)?
  - Please be specific. For example, instead of saying “We want to study employee performance appraisal,” say “I want to study gender-based discrimination in performance appraisal.”
- Why is this topic important?
- Why are existing approaches inadequate?
- A brief plan on how to conduct the project.
- Who is going to do what by when?
- (Optional) Other important thoughts, information, or questions for the instructor to know

Please submit your team's proposal of no more one page and in any format here.
