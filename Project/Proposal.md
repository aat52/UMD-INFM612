# Final Project Proposal

Each student team will undertake a research/consulting study on a management topic the team chooses. The study should identify a management issue (e.g., a problem or opportunity) faced by one or more organizations, any type of organizations (e.g., multinationals, small/medium-sized, startups, functions/departments, project teams, online communities, platforms, ecosystems, etc.). It should seek to recommend strategies to address the issue identified (e.g., solving the problem or taking the opportunity).

In your project proposal, please include the following items:

- What is the management problem or opportunity in what organization(s)?
  - Please be specific. For example, instead of saying “We want to study employee performance appraisal,” say “I want to study gender-based discrimination in performance appraisal.”
- Why is this topic important?
- Why are existing approaches inadequate?
- A brief plan on how to conduct the project.
- Who is going to do what by when?
- (Optional) Other important thoughts, information, or questions for the instructor to know

Please submit your team's proposal of no more one page and in any format here.

## Feedback

With much interest and enthusiasm, I read both proposals. Since there has been a ton of published literature on remote/hybrid work, I suggest you pursue the first topic on AI in the workplace. However, the first topic is still too broad. Can you narrow it down? For example, if you are interested in how AI might enhance, rather than replace human workers, can you pick a particular industry (banking, professional legal service, higher education…) so you can have a more concrete discussion about AI in a specific setting? Or, you could select a specific function such as marketing, supply chain management, customer service. Although the first topic is better than the second, please find a specific angle to study the first topic.

For your interest, here are some possibly useful readings on this topic, just to get you started.
