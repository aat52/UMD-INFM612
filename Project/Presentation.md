### Feedback
Thanks very much for presenting to us a very informative project on AI in customer service. Your presentation addresses a number of key issues about this topic, including the benefits, concerns, and inclusivity. I wish you guys could slow down without have to speak so fast, to give the viewers time to focus on the key messages you are trying to deliver. Some of the slides at the beginning (Slides 2-6) are too wordy. Reading the text aloud exactly to the viewer is not an effective way to present. Use slides as *visual aid* to enhance your presentation, not to distract the viewer's attention from your presentation. The two cases on chatbot at WBA and virtual assistant at HSBC are very interesting! I wish you could spend more time/space analyzing the management problems in each case, by cutting other parts of the presentation, because the issues these two organizations are highly generalizable in other organizations and industries.

Presentations by other teams are available for viewing in the [assignments] subfolder in Panopto [https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1343936/external_tools/28827]. Have a look!
