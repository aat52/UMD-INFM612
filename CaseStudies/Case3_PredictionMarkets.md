This case is in the [coursepack](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/1023334).

Each team please prepare and submit a video presentation (approximately 5-6 slides within 10 minutes) to address the following study questions. Please submit your video presentation file with Panopto to the folder "INFM612-IM01: Management Concepts and Principles for Information Professionals-Spring 2023 pwang [assignments]". Please follow the instructions to submit your presentation in this [video tutorial](https://umd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=114498d4-e39a-4f7b-b5dc-af90014564ed).

- What are the best ways to encourage more traders and trading within internal company prediction markets? Are you more in favor of using "hard" incentives (e.g., cash rewards) or "soft" ones (e.g., t-shirts and "bragging rights")?
- Is it a good idea to encourage ALL employees to trade in these markets? Should insiders and/or highly uninformed people be allowed to trade? Do they help the market or hurt it?
- Will most managers welcome prediction markets within their companies? Why or why not? Will they welcome a prediction market about a project or outcome that they're responsible for?
